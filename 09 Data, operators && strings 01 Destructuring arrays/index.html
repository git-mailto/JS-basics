          <p>Must we not, ask ourselves what that is which, as we imagine, is liable to
            be scattered, and about which we fear? and what again is that about which we have no
            fear? And then we may proceed further to enquire whether that which suffers dispersion
            is or is not of the nature of soulâ€”our hopes and fears as to our own souls will turn upon
            the answers to these questions. </p>
