    <p>The Republic is full of hope and aspiration: the Laws bear the stamp of failure and
      disappointment. The one is a finished work which received the last touches of the
      author: the other is imperfectly executed, and apparently unfinished. The one has the
      grace and beauty of youth: the other has lost the poetical form, but has more of the
      severity and knowledge of life which is characteristic of old age. </p>
